Setting your overclock too high will prevent your Pi from booting. This is no big deal - just unplug the SD card and reduce the settings in its config.txt file, then boot it again.
Each Pi4 has a different limit, but nearly all of them can handle a 2GHz overclock.

Note: WoR does not use the GPU, so overclocking it won't make a noticeable difference.

2.1GHz overclock:
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2147
gpu_freq=700

Maximum settings for only the 8GB Pi4 and Pi400: (possibly dangerous)
initial_turbo=60
over_voltage=15
arm_freq_min=100
arm_freq=2350
gpu_freq=800
gpu_mem=512
